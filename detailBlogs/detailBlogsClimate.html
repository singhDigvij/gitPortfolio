            <h1>Climate change in India</h1>
            <small>December 2023</small>
            <img class="detailBlog-img" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1570095378004-ce65d6c2d5bb?q=80&w=1470&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" alt="climate change">

            <p>The footprint of climate change can already be seen in every corner of the planet. Erratic weather patterns, rising sea levels  and melting glaciers due to climate change, are reshaping societies across the globe. Through multilingual news and expert analysis, The Third Pole captures how these changes are unfolding in India, one of the world’s most climate vulnerable countries. In India, climate change is already affecting human health, wildlife, food production, clean water access and the economy at large.</p>

            <p>But in the case of India, these vulnerabilities come with a unique potential for change. Home to nearly 20% of the world’s population, the country is looking to transform its fast growing infrastructure and energy systems to reduce heat trapping emissions on a massive scale. 

                The outcome of these efforts are  globally important, as India is the third largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the United States. Since those two nations have presented bold plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2060 and 2050 respectively, India is today facing increasing pressure to step up its ambitions too, becoming the next battleground of the global clean energy transition.</p>
            

            <p>Our journalists and analysts cast a critical eye over India’s renewables story, as the country’s massive potential for solar energy development puts it on track to become a world leader in the clean energy sector, creating millions of new jobs and increasingly replacing fossil fuels in its energy basket. As more people move to its burgeoning cities, we track how India strives to electrify its mobility sector, addressing the chronic air pollution crisis which compounds the climate issue. </p>
